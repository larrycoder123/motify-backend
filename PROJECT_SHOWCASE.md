## 💡 Motivation – How It All Started

The project started during **Start Hackathon Vienna**, where Base (by Coinbase) provided a real-world case challenge to work in **36 hours**:

> **Build a meaningful product on the Base ecosystem.**

Our motivation was to:
- Build something **production-oriented**, not just a hackathon demo
- Learn how to work with **Base, smart contracts, and wallet execution**
- Combine entrepreneurship, product thinking, and technical depth

## 📈 Project Lifecycle

### 1️⃣ Ideation & Prototype (Start Hackathon Vienna)

- Developed the **core idea and product vision**
- Designed the **on-chain logic and incentive structure**
- Built a **working prototype** and pitch deck
- **Outcome:** 🏆 **Winner Overall** of the Hackathon (Base / Coinbase Case Challenge)

### 2️⃣ Validation & Scaling (Base Global Buildathon – Devfolio)

- Motivated by the local win, we applied to the **global Base Buildathon**
- Competing against **900+ teams worldwide**
- Expanded from prototype → **functional MVP**
- Implemented:
  - Live smart contracts
  - Wallet execution
  - Backend + frontend integration
- **Outcome:**
  - 🎖 **Top 50 projects selected globally**
  - 💰 **$5,000 Builder Grant from Base**
  - 🚀 Live MVP & demo deployed
